                <p class="lead mb-4">Players practice skills that are directly related to military situations, such as allocating resources, understanding the importance of sacrifice for a greater goal, studying moves, and predicting enemy reactions. It helps the military understand the importance of securing utilities for their disposal.

                    <h5>Research Process</h5>
                    <p class="lead mb-4">I studied military videos to gain a better understanding of strategy, tactics, and overall structure. This made it easy for me to draw parallels between military coordinance and chess play, such as the importance of maintaining control over critical areas, managing limited resources, and planning ahead. I searched into the depths of how chess influenced the strategic thinking of prominent military figures such as Napoleon Bonaparte. I also examined how wargames are employed by modern troops, which require an astronomical amount of critical-thinking and decision-making.                    </p>

                <h5>Product of Learning and Explanation</h5>
                <p class="lead mb-4">Napoleon was an avid chess player. The game helped him enhance his ability to forecast his opponents' movements, plan multiple steps ahead, and effectively manage limited resources—all of which are critical skills for his campaigns. Abraham Lincoln's leadership during the Civil War required a mix of military and political challenges, similar to balancing offense and defense on a chessboard. Despite not being a military leader, chess had a great effect on Bobby Fischer's and Mikhail Tal's fame during the Cold War reflected how chess was viewed.

        <h1>The Effects of Chess</h1>
        <div class="lead mb-4">
            <p class="lead mb-4 px-5 my-3">During WW2, there was a mass leading from the Soviet Union. This brought publicity and got recognized by the military. The Soviet Union military then started to play chess at their disposal to discover sneaky attacks, also known as brilliant moves, which are unexpected moves in the system. This made them one of the most remarkable militaries in history.</p>
            <p class="lead mb-4 px-5 my-3">After chess was recognized after the break of WW2, the economt skyrocketed as chess went on air. Millions of Russians in the Soviet Union tuned into the capabilites this could bring upon their military. That's when Robert James Fischer came into the mix, bringing a staggering dominance to the competition.</p>

                              This page was created by using the Bootstrap.  The Bootstrap created the basic template for this page.  Then, I had to code in the style, formatting, and other elements to make this page look like a proper page.  For example, I used a combination of CSS and HTML in order to create the sections the appopriate width and color.  The changes in font were due to a mixture of inserting code and using the default font that is automatically inserted when one creates a website.
                            </p>

                              By completing this project, I learned that you can use Bootstrap to create websites quicker, saving a lot of time.  I also learned the code needed for embedding videos and other forms of media.
